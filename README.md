# LendingClub Loan Default Prediction üìäüöÄ

## Overview
LendingClub is a major US peer-to-peer lending company. This project aims to **predict** whether a borrower will **repay** a loan or **default** using historical loan data.  
We build a **binary classification model** using **Keras** and **TensorFlow**, preparing the way for real-world deployment to assess new customer applications.

## Project Goal
- Predict the probability of loan repayment based on customer and loan data.
- Help minimize financial risk by identifying high-risk borrowers.
- Evaluate model performance using classification metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **ROC-AUC**, etc.

## Dataset Information
- Data Source: LendingClub public loan dataset (Kaggle)
- Target Variable: `loan_status`
  - Typically values like `"Fully Paid"` vs `"Charged Off"`
- Features include:
  - **Loan Info:** Amount, Term, Interest Rate, Installment
  - **Borrower Info:** Employment Length, Annual Income, Home Ownership
  - **Credit Info:** DTI (Debt-to-Income Ratio), Revolving Balance, Public Records
  - **Others:** Purpose of Loan, State, Application Type

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing** üßπ
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature engineering (e.g., encoding categorical variables)
   - Creating dummy variables (0/1)
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** üîé
   - Understanding patterns and distributions
3. **Model Building** üõ†
   - Keras Sequential API
   - Dense layers + Dropout layers
   - Sigmoid activation for binary classification
4. **Model Evaluation** üß™
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix
   - ROC Curve and AUC Score
5. **Prediction on New Data** üßë‚Äçüíª
   - Model predicts whether a new applicant is likely to default.

## Technologies Used
- Python üêç
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for preprocessing and evaluation)
- TensorFlow & Keras (for model building)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Run the notebook or Python scripts step-by-step.

4.Predict new applicants by passing data into the trained model.

## Results
- Achieved around XX% accuracy (you can fill this in after your results).

- Model shows strong capability to distinguish between repaid and defaulted loans.

## Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning with KerasTuner or RandomSearch

- Try advanced models like XGBoost, LightGBM for comparison

- Deployment with Flask API or Streamlit web app
